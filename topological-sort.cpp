    Prerequisite: DFS
        We can modify DFS to find the Topological Sorting of a graph. In DFS, we start from a vertex, we first print it, and then recursively call DFS for its adjacent vertices. 

    In topological sorting:
        We use a temporary stack. 
        We donâ€™t print the vertex immediately, 
        We first recursively call topological sorting for all its adjacent vertices, then push it to a stack. 
        Finally, print the contents of the stack. 

    Note: A vertex is pushed to stack only when all of its adjacent vertices (and their adjacent vertices and so on) are already in the stack
